Bullet Train is a [oh-my-zsh shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
theme based on the
[Powerline Vim plugin](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline). It aims for
simplicity, showing information only when it's relevant.

It currently shows:
- Current Python virtualenv
- Current Ruby version and gemset, through RVM
- Current Node.js version, through NVM
- Git status
- Timestamp
- Current directory

If you want add some new feature, of fix some bug, open an issue and lets hack
together.
